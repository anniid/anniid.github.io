<p>I am a single mom to a fiery four-year old. I am a volunteer soccer coach for her team. I think sometimes the idea of a single mom is someone who doesn't have their kid sometimes. That's not so in this case. Her father passed away, so it's just us.
   I have a full-time job that requires me to work on data daily, but I am not paid as a data scientist, engineer, or analyst.
   Instead I'm called a learning and development partner. I work at that job every day, 8 am to 5 pm. It is sometimes boring, sometimes awesome.
